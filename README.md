# README-Generator

## Description

This Repository shows code that will prompt the User to answer questions I created when it is called upon by the User. See Usage section for more detail on how to acess these questions. When questions are answered the code will generate your answers in the markdown format and generate a README. This challenge solves the time it can take to create a professional README file by formatting what you want to say in Markdown format. From this challenge I learned more about Node.js and how helpful it can be for devs when either testing code or trying to create something using the Terminal or console.

## Installation



## Usage

Run " node index.js" in the terminal and answer the questions. Your input "User Input" will then be used to make a professional README following certain basic guidelines. 
See Video for tutorial:
